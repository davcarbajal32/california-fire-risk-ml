# California-Fire-Risk-Predictor

Abstract
This project focuses on developing a Fire Risk Predictor, a machine learning model designed for predicting the likelihood of a wildfire based on features that include time of the year, temperature, wind speeds, and numerous more. The purpose of this model is to proactively assess / predict fire danger levels. Having this ability can lead to better improved resource allocation, and stronger levels of preparation to reduce the social, economical, and environmental impact of these fires. This project uses a large dataset of historical wildfires that have occurred in California, and will utilize / apply data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling techniques that will identify patterns and hidden information from the dataset that influence the potential fire risk. 

Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately identifies the likelihood of a wildfire on any given day in California. Wildfire instances have become increasingly more frequent in the state as time has passed, with some having extremely devastating social, economic, and environmental impacts. These risks highlight the need for proactive, data driven strategies that would assist in minimizing these potential impacts. Our motivation is to design a predictive system that can assist locations and have them better prepared. To do this our plan is to leverage historical wildfire data to better understand the conditions that have strong relationships to wildfire ignition.  

Dataset Details
The data set for this project contains just under 15,000 wildfire instances in California, with features such as the date, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average wind speed, fire start day, year, temperature range, wind to temperature ratio, month, season, lagged precipitation, lagged average wind speed, and day of the year. Our immediate goal with this data set is to identify the most influential features that prove to have the strongest relationships with wildfire ignition. Once these features are identified, we will use them to train our machine learning model to best calculate and predict the likelihood of wildfire occurrence on any given day in California. 
California Weather and Fire Prediction Dataset (1984–2025) with Engineered Features

Methology
Potential machine learning models that can be used are the following:
Logistic regression. This model would establish a baseline predictive analysis. 
Decision Trees, Random Forest. This model is visible, easily explainable, and also identifies non linear patterns.
